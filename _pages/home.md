excerpt: >
  The IACS System Testing and Assessment Rating (STAR) Methodology (IACS STAR) is intended to be a methodology to estimate the severity of identified risks to the IACS/OT environment. This methodology includes the classic qualitative risk calculation elements while adding the consequence considerations necessary for understanding risks to IACS/OT processes and equipment. Having a system in place that addresses IACS/OT concerns for rating risks will save time and eliminate arguing about prioritizations and improve countermeasure selection to quickly reduce risk.
